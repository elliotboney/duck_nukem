## ðŸ”§ CURRENT TECHNICAL STATUS
- **Main Game**: Fully functional with physics and animations
- **Sprite System**: Complete with real-time testing and updating
- **Animation System**: All three states (walk/run/jump) working correctly
- **Development Tools**: Sprite coordinate testing interface operational
- **Server Infrastructure**: Update server running on port 3001
- **Known Issues**: None critical - all major systems functional

## ðŸŽ® READY TO PLAY
The game is currently playable with:
- Smooth duck movement and physics
- Three animation states with proper sprite rendering
- Responsive controls (WASD/arrows + space + shift)
- Real-time sprite coordinate adjustment tools
- Automatic code generation and updating system

**Next major milestone**: Implement enemy bread loaves with AK-47s!
