## Latest Session (Ground & Cloud System Refinements)

### Session Overview
Fine-tuning and improvement session focused on perfecting ground positioning, duck-ground collision, and implementing proper cloud parallax using actual sprite assets.

### Major Accomplishments This Session

1. **Ground System Positioning Fixes**
   - **Ground Height Correction**: Reduced ground visual height from 100px to 60px to prevent oversized terrain
   - **Ground Positioning**: Moved ground from Y=500 to Y=850 for proper bottom-screen placement
   - **Duck-Ground Collision**: Fixed duck floating above ground by correcting collision detection math
   - **Coordinate System**: Properly aligned duck bottom edge (`this.y + frameHeight/2`) with ground level
   - **Visual Alignment**: Duck now stands perfectly on ground instead of floating in air

2. **Cloud System Overhaul**
   - **Sprite Integration**: Replaced procedural clouds with actual `clouds.png` asset from images folder
   - **Parallax Implementation**: Set clouds to scroll at 0.2x speed for proper depth effect
   - **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Fixed cloud squishing by using natural image dimensions
   - **Infinite Scrolling**: Implemented seamless horizontal tiling for endless cloud repetition
   - **Performance**: Optimized tiling logic with improved offset calculations

3. **Background Layer Refinements**
   - **Asset Loading**: Added proper sprite loading system for clouds.png
   - **Layer Positioning**: Positioned clouds at 5% from screen top using natural height
   - **Tiling Logic**: Enhanced horizontal looping with bulletproof edge case handling
   - **Visual Quality**: Maintained cloud image quality without stretching or distortion

4. **Game Feel Improvements**
   - **Screen Layout**: Achieved proper platformer layout with ground at bottom and sky above
   - **Depth Perception**: Clouds moving at different speed creates convincing parallax effect
   - **Movement Feedback**: Duck walking/running creates natural world scrolling sensation
   - **Visual Polish**: Seamless cloud repetition maintains immersion during long travels

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Ground System Corrections
- **Ground Level**: Final position at Y=850 for bottom-screen placement
- **Collision Detection**: `duckBottom = this.y + frameHeight/2` for proper edge calculation
- **Landing Position**: `this.y = groundLevel - frameHeight/2` for center-based positioning
- **Visual Sizing**: 60px soil + 10px grass = 70px total ground thickness

#### Cloud Parallax Implementation
- **Asset Loading**: `import cloudsSprite from '../../assets/images/clouds.png'`
- **Scroll Speed**: 0.2x camera movement for distant cloud effect
- **Tiling Logic**: `wrappedOffset = offset % textureWidth` for seamless repetition
- **Coverage**: `startX = -wrappedOffset - textureWidth` ensures no gaps
- **Natural Sizing**: Preserves original cloud image aspect ratio

#### Layer Rendering Order
- **Sky Gradient**: 0x speed (static background)
- **Clouds Image**: 0.2x speed (slow parallax) - **UPDATED**
- **Distant Hills**: 0.6x speed (procedural)
- **Near Hills**: 0.8x speed (procedural)
- **Ground**: 1x speed (with camera)

### Files Modified This Session
- `src/game/world/Ground.ts` - **UPDATED**: Fixed ground height and rendering
- `src/game/world/Background.ts` - **UPDATED**: Clouds.png integration and tiling
- `src/game/core/Game.ts` - **UPDATED**: Ground level positioning (Y=850)
- `src/game/entities/Duck.ts` - **UPDATED**: Collision detection math fixes
- `session_context.md` - **UPDATED**: Current session documentation

### Impact and Benefits
- **Perfect Ground Positioning**: Duck now stands naturally on ground at screen bottom
- **Professional Visual Quality**: Clouds maintain crisp appearance without distortion
- **Infinite World Feel**: Seamless cloud tiling creates sense of endless sky
- **Proper Platformer Layout**: Ground placement follows established gaming conventions
