# Parker Duck Game - Session Context

## Current Project State

### Overview
Side-scrolling browser game featuring a white duck with bow tie as protagonist. Built with TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas, and Webpack. The game includes sprite-based animations, physics, and a sophisticated sprite coordinate management system.

### Architecture
- **Main Game**: Webpack dev server on port 9000
- **Update Server**: Node.js Express server on port 3001 for sprite coordinate management
- **Sprite Testing**: HTML interface for real-time sprite coordinate adjustment

### Current Game Features
- Duck character with physics (movement, jumping, gravity, ground collision)
- Three animation states: Walk, Run, Jump
- Keyboard controls: WASD/arrows for movement, Space for jump, Shift for run
- Sprite-based animations using duck2.png (1024x1024 sprite sheet)
- Real-time sprite coordinate testing and updating system

## Recent Session Work

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Fixed Autosave Issue**
   - Removed `autoSave()` calls from all input fields in sprite-test.html
   - Eliminated page jumping caused by status message updates
   - Maintained manual save functionality via "Save Coordinates" button

2. **Fixed Server Communication**
   - Updated fetch URL from `/update-duck-code` to `http://localhost:3001/update-duck-code`
   - Resolved 404 errors when exporting sprite coordinates
   - Ensured proper communication between sprite test (port 9000) and update server (port 3001)

3. **Implemented Game File Integration**
   - Added `/get-frame-data` endpoint to update server
   - Modified sprite test to load coordinates from actual game files instead of localStorage
   - Added "Reload from Game" button for manual refresh
   - Created fallback to localStorage if server unavailable

4. **Fixed Animation System**
   - Updated Duck.ts render method to use all three animation types (walk, run, jump)
   - Previously only walk animation was working
   - Now properly switches between walkFrameData, runFrameData, and jumpFrameData based on current animation state

5. **Added Sprite Mirroring**
   - Implemented horizontal sprite flipping when duck faces left
   - Added `facingLeft` boolean property to track direction
   - Uses canvas transformations (ctx.scale(-1, 1)) for flipping
   - Duck maintains facing direction when idle or jumping

6. **Migrated to Proper Sprite System**
   - Switched from duck2.png (1024x1024 with inconsistent positioning) to duck_walking.png
   - New sprite: 532x90 pixels with 7 frames at 76x90 each
   - Proper frame spacing and consistent sizing
   - Updated frame duration from 100ms to 60ms for better animation speed
   - Increased run speed from 350px/s to 650px/s

7. **Comprehensive JSDoc Documentation**
   - Added detailed JSDoc documentation to all core game files
   - Duck.ts: Complete class and method documentation with examples
   - Animation.ts: Full API documentation with usage examples
   - InputHandler.ts: Comprehensive input handling documentation
   - Game.ts: Main game loop and architecture documentation
   - index.ts: Entry point documentation with configuration details
   - update-server.js: Server API documentation with endpoint specifications

8. **Established Coding Standards**
   - Created `.cursorrules` file with comprehensive development guidelines
   - Mandatory JSDoc for all classes, methods, and functions
   - TypeScript best practices and game development patterns
   - Performance guidelines and error handling standards
   - Project-specific guidelines for sprites, physics, and architecture

### Current Sprite System (Latest)
```typescript
// NEW: Walking Animation (duck_walking.png - 532x90, 7 frames)
const walkFrameData = [
    { x: 0, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },      // frame 0
    { x: 76, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },     // frame 1
    { x: 152, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },    // frame 2
    { x: 228, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },    // frame 3
    { x: 304, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },    // frame 4
    { x: 380, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },    // frame 5
    { x: 456, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },    // frame 6
];

// Animation Settings:
// - Frame Duration: 60ms (~16.7 fps)
// - Sprite Cols: 7
// - Frame Size: 76x90 pixels
// - Horizontal Flipping: Enabled for left movement
```

### Key Components

#### Duck.ts
- Main character class with physics and animation
- Uses manual sprite coordinate arrays instead of grid-based calculation
- Handles three animation states: ANIM_WALK (0), ANIM_RUN (1), ANIM_JUMP (3)
- Renders with proper frame data selection based on current animation

#### update-server.js
- Express server on port 3001
- `/update-duck-code` endpoint: Updates Duck.ts with new sprite coordinates
- `/get-frame-data` endpoint: Reads current coordinates from Duck.ts file
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

#### sprite-test.html
- Real-time sprite coordinate testing interface
- Loads current coordinates from game file on startup
- Individual controls for each frame (X, Y, Width, Height)
- Auto-updates visual previews on input changes
- Export functionality updates game code automatically

### Development Workflow
1. Adjust coordinates in sprite-test.html interface
2. Use "Export & Update Game" to push changes to Duck.ts
3. Refresh main game to see changes
4. Use "Reload from Game" to sync test interface with current game state

## Current Issues/Notes
- âœ… RESOLVED: Sprite positioning issues - now using properly formatted sprites
- âœ… RESOLVED: Frame size inconsistencies - new sprites are consistently 76x90
- âœ… Walking animation fully functional with proper frame rate
- âœ… Sprite mirroring working for left/right movement
- âœ… Server communication functioning properly
- âœ… No autosave interference with page scrolling
- âœ… COMPLETED: Comprehensive JSDoc documentation across all core files
- âœ… COMPLETED: Established coding standards and development guidelines
- ðŸ”„ PENDING: Need running and jumping sprite sheets in same format as walking
- ðŸ”„ PENDING: Re-implement run/jump animation states once sprites available

## Next Steps Suggestions
- Consider adding enemy entities (cartoon bread loaves with AK-47s)
- Implement scrolling background
- Add sound effects
- Create level design system
- Add collision detection for enemies/projectiles
