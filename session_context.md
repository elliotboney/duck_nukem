# Parker Duck Game - Session Context

## Current Project State

### Overview
Side-scrolling browser game featuring a white duck with bow tie as protagonist. Built with TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas, and Webpack. The game includes sprite-based animations, physics, scrolling background with parallax effects, and a sophisticated camera system.

### Architecture
- **Main Game**: Webpack dev server on port 9000
- **Update Server**: Node.js Express server on port 3001 for sprite coordinate management
- **Sprite Testing**: HTML interface for real-time sprite coordinate adjustment
- **World Systems**: Camera, Background, and Ground systems for immersive gameplay

### Current Game Features
- Duck character with physics (movement, jumping, gravity, ground collision)
- Three animation states: Walk, Run, Jump
- Keyboard controls: WASD/arrows for movement, Space for jump, Shift for run
- Sprite-based animations using dedicated sprite files for each animation type
- **Scrolling background with parallax effects (sky, clouds, hills)**
- **Camera system that smoothly follows the duck**
- **Proper ground collision and terrain rendering**
- Real-time sprite coordinate testing and updating system

## Recent Session Work

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Fixed Autosave Issue**
   - Removed `autoSave()` calls from all input fields in sprite-test.html
   - Eliminated page jumping caused by status message updates
   - Maintained manual save functionality via "Save Coordinates" button

2. **Fixed Server Communication**
   - Updated fetch URL from `/update-duck-code` to `http://localhost:3001/update-duck-code`
   - Resolved 404 errors when exporting sprite coordinates
   - Ensured proper communication between sprite test (port 9000) and update server (port 3001)

3. **Implemented Game File Integration**
   - Added `/get-frame-data` endpoint to update server
   - Modified sprite test to load coordinates from actual game files instead of localStorage
   - Added "Reload from Game" button for manual refresh
   - Created fallback to localStorage if server unavailable

4. **Fixed Animation System**
   - Updated Duck.ts render method to use all three animation types (walk, run, jump)
   - Previously only walk animation was working
   - Now properly switches between walkFrameData, runFrameData, and jumpFrameData based on current animation state

5. **Added Sprite Mirroring**
   - Implemented horizontal sprite flipping when duck faces left
   - Added `facingLeft` boolean property to track direction
   - Uses canvas transformations (ctx.scale(-1, 1)) for flipping
   - Duck maintains facing direction when idle or jumping

6. **Migrated to Proper Sprite System**
   - Switched from duck2.png (1024x1024 with inconsistent positioning) to duck_walking.png
   - New sprite: 532x90 pixels with 7 frames at 76x90 each
   - Proper frame spacing and consistent sizing
   - Updated frame duration from 100ms to 60ms for better animation speed
   - Increased run speed from 350px/s to 650px/s

7. **Comprehensive JSDoc Documentation**
   - Added detailed JSDoc documentation to all core game files
   - Duck.ts: Complete class and method documentation with examples
   - Animation.ts: Full API documentation with usage examples
   - InputHandler.ts: Comprehensive input handling documentation
   - Game.ts: Main game loop and architecture documentation
   - index.ts: Entry point documentation with configuration details
   - update-server.js: Server API documentation with endpoint specifications

8. **Established Coding Standards**
   - Created `.cursorrules` file with comprehensive development guidelines
   - Mandatory JSDoc for all classes, methods, and functions
   - TypeScript best practices and game development patterns
   - Performance guidelines and error handling standards
   - Project-specific guidelines for sprites, physics, and architecture

9. **Implemented Running Animation System**
   - Added duck_running.png sprite support (1 row, 4 frames)
   - Integrated three-state animation system: ANIM_WALK, ANIM_RUN, ANIM_JUMP
   - Running animation triggered by holding Shift key during movement
   - Faster animation speed for running (40ms vs 60ms for walking)
   - Proper animation switching based on movement state and input

10. **Implemented Scrolling Background and Ground Systems**
    - **Camera System**: Smooth following camera with world-to-screen coordinate transformation
    - **Background System**: Multi-layer parallax scrolling with procedural sky, clouds, and hills
    - **Ground System**: Proper terrain collision with visual ground rendering (soil + grass)
    - **World Architecture**: Coordinate system supporting 2000-pixel world width
    - **Performance**: Optimized rendering with layer-based approach and camera culling

    { x: 456, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },    // frame 6
];

// Running Animation (duck_running.png - 304x90, 4 frames)
const runFrameData = [
    { x: 0, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },      // frame 0

    { x: 152, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },    // frame 2
    { x: 228, y: 0, width: 76, height: 90 },    // frame 3
];

// Animation Settings:
// - Walking Frame Duration: 60ms (~16.7 fps)
// - Running Frame Duration: 40ms (~25 fps)
// - Frame Size: 76x90 pixels (consistent across all sprites)
// - Horizontal Flipping: Enabled for left movement
// - Animation States: ANIM_WALK (0), ANIM_RUN (1), ANIM_JUMP (2)
```

### World Systems Architecture
```typescript
// Camera System
const camera = new Camera(canvasWidth, canvasHeight);
camera.setBounds(0, 2000); // World width: 2000px
camera.setSmoothing(0.05); // Smooth following
camera.followTarget(duck.getX(), duck.getY());

// Background Layers (parallax speeds)
- Sky Gradient: 0x speed (static)
- Far Clouds: 0.1x speed
- Near Clouds: 0.3x speed  
- Distant Hills: 0.6x speed
- Near Hills: 0.8x speed

// Ground System
const ground = new Ground(500); // Ground level at Y=500
- Soil layer: Brown (#8B4513)
- Grass layer: Green (#228B22), 10px height
- Proper collision detection with duck height
```
